# Direct Avatar Playback - Simple & Reliable

This is a **completely different approach** that directly animates your avatar bones without going through the complex HolisticSolution system.

## How It Works

Instead of trying to feed data through HolisticSolution, this script:
1. **Finds your avatar** automatically (DebugModel or any Animator)
2. **Maps the bones** using Unity's standard HumanBodyBones system
3. **Directly sets bone rotations** from your capture data
4. **Simple and reliable** - no dependencies on bone settings or complex systems

## Setup

1. **Add the Script**: 
   - Create an empty GameObject
   - Add the `DirectAvatarPlayback` component
   - The script will automatically find your DebugModel

2. **That's it!** - No complex setup needed

## Controls

- **P** = Play/Pause playback
- **O** = Stop playback  
- **L** = Load different capture file

## What You'll See

The script shows you:
- How many bones were found and mapped
- Which avatar it's using
- Playback progress in real-time

## Why This Works Better

**Old approach problems:**
- Depended on HolisticSolution working correctly
- Required bone settings to be enabled
- Complex data flow through multiple systems

**New approach advantages:**
- ✅ **Direct bone control** - no complex dependencies
- ✅ **Automatic setup** - finds your avatar automatically  
- ✅ **Clear debugging** - shows exactly what's happening
- ✅ **Reliable** - simple direct animation

## Debug Info

Watch the Console for:
```
[DirectPlayback] Found DebugModel: DebugModel
[DirectPlayback] Avatar setup complete. Found 20 bones.
[DirectPlayback] Mapped bone: Hips -> mixamorig:Hips
[DirectPlayback] Starting direct bone animation playback - 312 frames
```

If you see "Avatar setup complete. Found X bones" then it should work!

## Troubleshooting

**If no bones are found:**
- Make sure your DebugModel has an Animator component
- Check that the Animator has a valid Avatar asset assigned
- Ensure the Avatar is configured as Humanoid

**If playback seems wrong:**
- The capture data might be in a different coordinate system
- Try adjusting the playbackSpeed setting
